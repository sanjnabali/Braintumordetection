# Medical Imaging for Tumor Detection

## Project Description
This project applies computer graphics techniques to a crucial real-world application: medical imaging, specifically in the detection and visualization of tumors. By augmenting medical scans with enhanced graphical methods, this project aims to improve the visibility and detection of tumors, assisting medical professionals in diagnosing conditions more accurately. The use of 3D visualization and graphical overlays not only aids in interpreting complex medical data but also helps create a clearer understanding of the spatial relationships between tumor growth and surrounding tissues.

**Note**: This project is still in **processing** and ongoing development. New features, improvements, and optimizations are being added regularly.

## Features
- **Tumor Detection Visualization**: Enhanced graphical representation of tumors, allowing for better identification in medical scans.
- **3D Visualization**: The integration of 3D models to display tumor growths and their spatial relationships with surrounding organs and tissues.
- **Graphical Overlays**: Use of overlays to highlight areas of concern and provide additional context for better understanding.
- **Enhanced Diagnostic Accuracy**: By providing a clearer view of tumors and their interactions with nearby tissues, the project aims to improve diagnostic confidence and precision.
- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly interface that allows medical professionals to interact with the data, rotate 3D models, and zoom into specific areas for deeper analysis.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have Python installed and the necessary dependencies (e.g., `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `PyQt5`, `vtk`, etc.).
3. Set up the environment and install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Load medical scan data (e.g., DICOM files) into the project interface.
5. Run the program to visualize the 3D models and tumor detection overlays.
# Usage
1. Load Medical Data: Upload DICOM or other compatible medical scan files to analyze.
2. Visualize Tumors: The system will automatically detect and highlight potential tumors, overlaying graphical representations on the scan.
3. 3D Interaction: Rotate and zoom in on 3D models to examine tumors from different angles and perspectives.
4. Adjust Overlays: Customize the graphical overlays to suit different diagnostic requirements or visual preferences.
